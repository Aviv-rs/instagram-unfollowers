      {
        "question": "Is my data secure when using this tool?",
        "answer": "Yes, all data processing happens locally in your browser. Your Instagram data never leaves your device and is not sent to our servers. This ensures complete privacy and security."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the unfollower detection?",
        "answer": "The tool identifies users who don't follow you back with 100% accuracy. However, for detecting users who unfollowed you, Instagram doesn't provide historical follower data, so we can only show users who were following you in previous exports but not in the current one."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why should I use this instead of other tools?",
        "answer": "Our tool provides privacy-first analysis without requiring your Instagram login credentials. Many other tools require access to your account, which poses security risks. Our tool works with your exported data file, keeping your account secure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see who viewed my profile?",
        "answer": "No, Instagram does not provide data on who views your profile, so no tool can accurately show this information."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I check for unfollowers?",
        "answer": "Instagram limits data exports, so we recommend checking once every 1-2 months. This also allows enough time for meaningful changes in your follower relationships."
